# Scheduling API

This is an API similar to Calendly.com where you can create a public calendar and let others book meetings with you based on your availability.

The API is hosted at http://34.93.116.152

The docs and available endpoints are defined at http://34.93.116.152/docs and http://34.93.116.152/redoc

There is optional Google Calendar integration available. To integrate Google Calendar, create a public google calendar which the API can access to create events for you.

Follow the steps at https://docs.simplecalendar.io/find-google-calendar-id/ to find your Calendar ID.

Pass this calendar ID while creating a new user using the API.
